The Test directory should hold special files only for the test team. It usually contains test scripts, files that unlock cheats, and test utilities. Some games have a logging feature that writes diagnostic, warning, and error messages to a text file—the Test directory is a great place for them. Most importantly, it should contain the release notes for the latest build. The release notes are a list of features that work, or don’t work, in the latest build. They also contain quick instructions about anything the test team needs to know, such as how to expose a certain feature or a part of your game that needs special attention. As you are developing your project, I strongly encourage you to keep the release notes up-to-date. If you hand your game over to a testing team, they won’t have to pull out their hair trying to figure out how to get your project to work
