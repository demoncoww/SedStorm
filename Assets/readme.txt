The Assets directory is going to store all your art, animation, and sound assets in their raw, naked form. This directory is likely going to get huge, so make sure the source control system is configured to filter it out for people who don’t care about it. I say “raw” and “naked” not just because I enjoy putting it in print—these assets are those not used by the game directly, but those that are used by artists, designers, or sound engineers while they are working on them. Think of it as the same kind of directory that programmers use for their code. When the assets get imported or packed into game files that are used by the game directly, they’ll be inside the Game directory where all the distributable stuff lives. One more thing—the Assets directory will be a huge, complicated hierarchy that will most likely be created to appease the whims of artists or sound engineers, so don’t expect to have much control over it.
