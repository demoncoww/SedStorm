When a project is being built, each build target will place temporary files into the Temp directory. Each build project, building configuration, and platform can be segregated into their own directories underneath Temp. For example, the OBJ and other temporary files for the Debug configuration of the GameCode4 project compiled with Visual Studio 2010 for Win32 can be stored in Temp\GameCode4_2010Win32Debug. Doing it this way makes it very easy to create a directory structure that supports multiple compiled targets, multiple compilers, multiple platforms, and multiple build configurations. If you think you might not need this, think about building a project for both Android and iOS—because being able to store the results of a build on a server might be very convenient, and if you don’t give each build flavor a safe place to live, they might overwrite each other.
