The Game directory should hold the release build and every game data file your game needs to run and anything that will get distributed to your players. You should be able to send the contents of the Game directory to a separate testing group or to someone in the press, and they’d have everything they would need to run and test the game. You also want to ensure that they don’t get anything you want to keep to yourself, such as confidential project documentation or your crown jewels—the source code. Generally, you’ll place release executables and DLLs in Game and store all your game data and config files in Game/Data. If you take the time to set up a directory that stores the files that you may be providing to others from time to time, you’ll likely avoid sending out your source code or internal project design documents. Documentation that will get sent to your players on disc or downloaded, like help files, also should be stored here. Printed documentation should be stored separately; I’d suggest in its own hierarchy inside the Assets directory. 

the 'data' directory holds the data needed by the executable

\Game\Windows\Release hold the executable for Windows and all the .dll files needed
