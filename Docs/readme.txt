The Docs directory is a reference for the development team. It should have an organized hierarchy to store both design documents and technical specifications. I always put a copy of the contract exhibits and milestone acceptance criteria in it for my team, since these documents specify our obligations to the publisher or investor. (You don’t want to ever forget who is paying the bills!) While I’m developing a project, it’s not unusual to find detailed character scripts, initial user interface designs, and other works in progress in the Docs directory.
